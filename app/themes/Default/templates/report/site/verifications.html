<p>The Verifications Report will return a list of every patient verification letter entered into the system between the following dates:</p>
<hr/>
[% INCLUDE util/date_picker.html
    label   = 'Start'
    name    = 'start_date'
    value   = 'today'
    wraptag = 'p'
%]

[% INCLUDE util/date_picker.html
    label   = 'End'
    name    = 'end_date'
    value   = 'today'
    wraptag = 'p'
%]
<p>(Please note that these are the dates the letter was entered into the database, not the verification date of the letter itself...)<p>
