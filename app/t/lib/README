Test files are laid out under one of two hierarchies, based on their function.

t/<test type> -- tests for things like Mechanize

<theme name> -- theme-specific support code

<theme name>/t -- theme-specific test cases

so e.g. t/Mechanize/Report.pm is the generic test case for Report controllers,
while Default/t/Mechanize/Report.pm is the test case for the Default theme's
Report controller.
