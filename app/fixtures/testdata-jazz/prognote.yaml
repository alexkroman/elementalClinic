  note_body: Monk's manner was idiosyncratic even for a jazz musician. He would seldom speak. He would wear odd clothes and hats and had an unusual percussive manner in playing piano. At times he would stop playing leave the piano and dance while the other musicians in the combo played.

  note_body: In August 1951 New York City police investigated a parked car occupied by Monk and friend Bud Powell. The police found narcotics in the car. Monk refused to testify against his friend so the police took his Cabaret card. Without it he was unable to play in New York venues where liquor was served.

  note_body: "Having first taken part in the Artists United Against Apartheid recording, Davis signed with Warner Brothers records and reunited with Marcus Miller. The resulting record, Tutu (1986), would be his first to feature modern studio tools-programmed synthesizers, samples and drum loops-to create an entirely new setting for Davis's playing. Ecstatically reviewed on its release, the album would frequently be described as a modern version of the classic Sketches of Spain, and won a Grammy award in 1987."

  note_body: "Davis absented himself from the music industry for five years. For much of this time he was seriously ill, and a serious cocaine addiction was also beginning to take its toll. As Gil Evans said, 'His organism is tired. And after all the music he's contributed for 35 years, he needs a rest.' However, by the beginning of the 1980s he was back in good health and ready to assemble a new band."

The same year, Davis prepared to tour again, and formed a touring band with largely different members from those who had played on the album. In May, they played two dates as part of the Newport Jazz Festival, and the concerts, as well as the live recording We Want Miles from the ensuing tour, were well reviewed."

Whether played by Davis's many proteges, including Herbie Hancock, Chick Corea and John McLaughlin's Mahavishnu Orchestra and the Weather Report (founders Wayne Shorter and Joe Zawinul both spent time in Davis's bands), Davis's influence could be heard everywhere, much as it could after each of his previous revolutionary advances."

If I type a long enough note here, I will end up with test data that overflows the bounds of the UI, which is what I want.  Then I will be able to design a correction.  You will notice that I am not using contractions.  Partly that is to make the text longer, and partly it is because this string is single-quoted in the test data, and I am too lazy to change the quoting.'
