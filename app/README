INSTALLATION

eleMentalClinic uses Module::Build for its installation.

  perl Build.PL
  ./Build
  ./Build test
  sudo ./Build install

You will need PostgreSQL 8.2 or 8.3 configured, and a database user for
eleMentalClinic.

See the INSTALL file for more details on prerequisites, installation, and
configuration.

QUICKSTART

*** To set up a fresh checkout:

  perl Build.PL

This will run `Build.PL` and set up a `Build` script for common development
tasks.

  ./Build prereq_report

This gives a list of all dependencies, with versions and whether or not they
are installed.

  ./Build installdeps

This will install all missing dependencies.

If you don't already have one, create a Postgres user and database to
test EMC with.  Either use something like pgAdmin or use psql as a
Postgres admin.  Here's an example assuming that "postgres" is your
postgres admin account.  It creats an account called "emctest" and a
databsase "emctest" owned by it.

  sudo -u postgres psql

  postgres=# create user emctest with password 'changethis';
  CREATE ROLE
  postgres=# create database elementalclinic owner emctest;
  CREATE DATABASE

Now you can run

  ./Build dev-setup

This will prompt you for a database user and password.

The database user you choose will need to be able to create and drop the
'elementalclinic' database.

If your database is named something other than 'elementalclinic', or is on a
different host or port, you can configure those parameters by running
`elementalclinic_setup` manually:

  perl -Ilib script/elementalclinic_setup --dev --db-name myclinic --db-host db.myclinic.com

See `script/elementalclinic_setup` for more details.


*** To load data into your database:

  ./Build db-clean-dev

This will load the basic schema and data necessary for eMC to function.

  ./Build db-testdata-jazz

This loads a set of test data, with appointments, progress notes, clients, etc.

*** To run a test webserver:

  script/elementalclinic_web_server.pl

The test webserver starts on port 3000 by default.  To log on as the
administrative user:

  user: root
  pass: password

You will be prompted to change the password the first time you log in.

*** To run the tests:

  ./Build test

Currently, the tests require Apache 2.2 and mod_perl2 installed to run; without
them, the web tests (t/9XX and t/theme) will all fail noisily.

If you loaded the testdata-jazz set, you'll need to clean the database before
running the tests:

  ./Build db-clean-dev
  ./Build test
