Installing eleMentalClinic
---------------------------

Summary
=======
This is a high-level overview.  You should understand Perl, Apache, and
Unix.

Requirements
============

Unix-like OS
------------

PostgreSQL 8.2 or 8.3
---------------------
eleMentalClinic will not install or run on any other database.

Webserver
---------
Using mod_perl, eleMentalClinic will only run on Apache 2.2 and higher.  Any
webserver that supports the FastCGI protocol should also work.

Perl
----
Version 5.8.1 or above.

Root
----
Root access is required to modify Apache and install Perl modules.

Firefox
-------
eleMentalClinic targets Mozilla Firefox.

Installation
============
1. Install eleMentalClinic & Perl modules
2. Create a database
3. Configure eleMentalClinic
4. Deploy
5. Insert data
6. Configure your webserver
7. Configure your browser
8. Login
9. Configure automatic notification (optional)

1.  eleMentalClinic is a standard Perl distribution.  Run:

    $ perl Build.PL
    $ ./Build
    $ sudo ./Build install

    If `Build.PL` reported missing dependencies, you have a few options:

    To install all dependencies using the CPAN shell, run

    $ sudo ./Build installdeps

    This will only work with a relatively recent CPAN.pm; if you get an error
    that says "Cannot test ., don't know what it is", upgrade your CPAN.pm,
    e.g.:

    $ sudo cpan CPAN

    Alternately, install eleMentalClinic from CPAN instead:

    $ sudo cpan eleMentalClinic

    To build Debian packages for any missing dependencies using CPANPLUS, run

    $ make debs
    $ sudo dpkg -i $(find debs/ -name \*.deb)

    You'll need CPANPLUS::Dist::Deb installed to build Debian packages.

    To install or build dependencies, you'll need the Postgres header files
    unless you've already installed DBD::Pg.  On Ubuntu, these are in the
    'libpq-dev' package.

2.  Create a PostgreSQL database and give yourself access to it.  The database
    must be named "elementalclinic", or you must specify a different name in
    the next step.

3.  Run `sudo elementalclinic_setup`; you will be prompted for the database username and
    password that you configured in step 2.

    You will also need to give the username your webserver runs as, or the
    username that eleMentalClinic will run as (if they are different).

    This will create a configuration file in /etc/elementalclinic/config.yaml,
    as well as any directories under /var that are necessary for
    eleMentalClinic.

4.  Deploy

    This will install configuration files and paths that cannot be part of a
    normal perl distribution.

    $ sudo ./Build deploy

5.  Insert data
    This will create the schema
    $ elementalclinic_migration --to 999

    This will insert the bare minimum data.
    $ sudo elementalclinic_fixture_import -f /usr/share/elementalclinic/fixtures/base-sys

    If you would like the testdata-jazz fixture you may load it after loading base-sys.
    $ sudo elementalclinic_fixture_import -f /usr/share/elementalclinic/fixtures/testdata-jazz

6.  Configure your web server
    There is an example apache config file in etc/httpd.conf. This file should
    be renamed and "elementalclinic.conf" and copied to your apache available
    hosts folder (/etc/apache2/sites-available/ on ubuntu.)

    If you want to use the example config file as-is you will need to Edit your
    /etc/hosts file to add the following line.

        127.0.0.1 elementalclinic

    Run the following to enable the emc vhost
    $ sudo a2ensite elementalclinic.conf
    $ sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 reload

    You should now be able to access elementalclinic by pointing your
    web-browser to http://elementalclinic NOTE: elementalclinic will only be
    accessible to the machine on which it runs. You will need to modify your
    apache config in order to allow outside access.

7.  Configure Firefox

    You should configure Firefox to allow cookies and popups from the site
    serving eleMental Clinic (e.g. localhost).  Also, make sure your browser is at
    least 1024 pixels wide.

8.  Login

    You should be able to login as the root user "root" with password "password".
    You will be prompted to change this password upon your first login.
    The old login clinic/dba is now part of testdata-jazz, don't rely on it.

9.  Automatic appointment and Renewal notifications

    The script misc/send_notifications.pl is used to generate and send
    notifications.  The best option is to create a cronjob that executes this
    script at least once a day. A record is kept of all sent notifications; you
    can safely run this script many times each day without generating duplicate
    notifications.

    With no syntax the script will find all appointments and renewals between
    today's date and the number of days specified in your admin configuration.

    The usual way to add a cronjob is to type `crontab -e` and add a new line to
    the list of jobs.

    An example cron job line that will run the script every hour:

    0  *  *  *  *  /path/to/send_notifications.pl

    Running once each hour is reasonable; it will not interfere with the system
    by running too often, and it will also send out notifications within an
    hour of an appointment being added to the system (useful if the new
    appointment is for the next day).
