Contributing to eleMental Clinic
--------------------------------

From the original mission statement:

    Furtherance of knowledge is a collective endeavor. No one developer has
    original ideas: ideas are always built on the contributions of others.  If
    you are a software developer and wish to build on our ideas or contribute
    to our source code, please contact us - we'd be very pleased to work with
    you.

We're happy for anyone to contribute to eleMental Clinic, but we do have
standards which must be followed.  These standards are technical in nature, and
do not specify what type of features or fixes we'll accept.  Please contact
us[1] if you have question.

All these standards, of course, presuppose that you're interested in sending
your code to us for inclusion in the applicaiton.  You're free to make any
modifications at all to your own copy.  We encourage you to consider sending us
your code, and making eleMental Clinic better for everyone.
