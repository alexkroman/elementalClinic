User Interface Standards
------------------------

UI must be as intuitive as possible
- In this case, we take "intuitive" to mean "works like the rest of the
  application."

Standards-compliant XHTML for markup<
- Some of the markup in the current UI does not validate; we will fix these
  issues in time.  All new UI must be compliant.

Standards-compliant CSS for layout
- All layout is done with CSS.  Tabular data is represented with tables.
