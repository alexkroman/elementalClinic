Testing standards
-----------------

- Every Perl object must have one and only one test file.
- This test file must test every method of the object for all reasonable
  failure and success conditions.
- Each test file must use test data from the Test.pm module, or your own
  sub-class of that module.
- Each test file must leave the test database exactly as it was found; test
  files may not have side effects which could affect other tests.
- Each test file must be repeatable; you must be able to run it 2 or 5 times in
  succession with the same results.
- Every bugfix in object code must be accompanied by a new test.

Test naming conventions
-----------------------

Tests must be named correctly in the test directory, with three numbers and an
object name.  For instance, "100client," "822client_prognote_report."  The
first of these numbers must fit the following scheme:

- 0??_test.t : infrastructure code.  code which helps the application work, but
  does not define business logic.

- 1??_test.t : core logic:  code which is required for the application, like
  Client.

- 2??_test.t - 7??_test.t : most objects which implement features should go here.

- 8??_test.t : reports.

- 9??_test.t : web application tests.  automated tests which directly
  manipulate the application.

- x??_test.t : temporary scratch space, for tests which will soon be moved
  elsewhere (note that this is a literal "x")
