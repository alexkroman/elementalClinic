Documentation standards
=======================

User documentation
------------------

    - All new and changed features must be documented so that a busy but
      motivated clinician can, in the least amount of time, answer her own
      questions.

Developer documentation
-----------------------

    - All new methods must have with accompanying POD (see below).

Incomplete code
---------------

    The best way to mark incomplete code is with a TODO test.  See the
    documentation for Test::More for more details.
    
    Barring that, use whichever of these is appropriate:
    
    - TODO:  means "I haven't started this yet, and I need to."
    - FIXME:  means "This doesn't work the way it should."
    - XXX:  means "Pay special attention to this."

    Any other comments should be informational only, for other developers who
    are reading the code.

POD (Plain Old Documentation)
-----------------------------

    - Here is a sample POD block for a method:

    # ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    =head2 save_rules( \@rule_ids, [ $payer_id ])

    Class method.

    Associates a list of rules with the system validation process (or with
    payer validation for C<$payer_id>, if supplied).  Uses the
    C<validation_rule_last_used> table.

    C<\@rule_ids> may be empty arrayref.  In this case, all rule records
    associated system validation (or with payer validation for C<$payer_id>)
    are removed.

    =cut

    # ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~
    sub save_rules {

- There is a skeleton you can copy for your own use in docs/POD-stub in this
  distribution.
