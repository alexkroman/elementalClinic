Security
--------
Last update: Nov 29, 2007

For maximum security, and for HIPAA compliance, we recommend the following
configuration and policy after installation:

- Encrypt all brower transmissions using HTTPS.
- Require that users change their passwords at specified intervals.
- Encrypt the filesystem on which the database is stored.
- Give only authorized personnel accounts on any application or database
  servers.
- If you are using a separate database server, encrypt all transmissions
  between the application server and database server.

- If you are using the scanned documents feature, be aware that files with patient
  data will be available to anyone with access to the server, regardless of whether
  they have a login to eMC.
