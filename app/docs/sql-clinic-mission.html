                    SQL Clinic - Mission Statement
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Open Source Software is computer software that is made available 
     free of restrictions on use or modificiation, and at no cost, to
     anyone who wants it. The developers of free software get satisfaction
     by providing a service to other people.  This is the philosophical
     basis for the SQL Clinic Project. 

     SQL Clinic Developers design software for the non-profit sector, in
     particular, social service agencies that serve persons in need.
     We design Open Source, or Free, Software because we feel the idea
     of "intellectual property" has no place in the public sector.
     "Intellectual Property" fosters competition over cooperation.
     We feel that cooperation, more than competition, benefits software
     with a social service mission.

     We believe that intellectual products are really social products as they
     are composed of ideas.  This is particularly true when the intellectual
     products are sponsored by public monies (as is the case for SQL Clinic.)
     Publicly funded entities that develop software have a moral obligation 
     to share any "intellectual property" that might benefit society.  In a
     sense publicly funded property is really "community property".  Thus we 
     feel it is our responsibility to contribute our ideas to the database 
     of human knowledge and to disseminate that knowledge, whenever and 
     whereever possible, particularly if it might help alleviate suffering.

     Furtherance of knowledge is a collective endeavor. No one developer
     has original ideas: ideas are always built on the contributions of 
     others.  If you are a software developer and wish to build on our ideas
     or contribute to our source code, please contact us - we'd be very 
     pleased to work with you.
