Installing eleMental Clinic on Mac OSX
--------------------------------------

0. Introduction
    Installing eleMental Clinic on OSX is a little bit different (i.e. more
    difficult) than installing it on, say, Ubuntu or other Debian-based
    distros. This guide will point out some important differences.

1. Install MacPorts

    One major difference with OSX is the notable lack of a package manager. If
    you do not already have MacPorts/DarwinPorts, get it now. Mount the image
    and install. Then you can just `port search *package*` to find the name of
    a package and `sudo port install *package*` to install it.

    Note that you may have to add the install path for MacPorts packages to
    your $PATH -- the default path is /opt/local

    If you don't want to install MacPorts, good luck. This guide will likely
    not help you.

2. Apache and Perl

    OSX comes preinstalled with both of these, but MacPorts doesn't play nice
    with them. Instead, install the versions of Apache2, Perl, and mod_perl2
    with MacPorts, as well as Postgres8.2 and any other packages you need.

    Unfortunately, many of the Debian packages for Perl modules do not have
    corresponding MacPorts packages, and dh-make-perl does not exist for
    MacPorts, so they must be installed through CPAN. Make sure that you are
    installing them using the MacPorts cpan binary, not through /usr/bin/cpan
