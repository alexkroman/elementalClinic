= HOW TO MAKE EMC PACKAGES =

Install the debian package tools:
$ sudo aptitude install dpkg-dev dh-make debhelper

You also need libpq-dev
$ sudo aptitude install libpq-dev

run the following:
$ make packages

this will create an ARCH-NAME dir with packages for emc and all dependancies.
example dir name: i686-Hardy

== Assumptions ==

This script assumes there is a checkout of emc trunk/app in ../app. To specify
one instead use CHECKOUT="..."

== How it works ==

First: locallib will bootstrap a local perl lib dir in the current directory. In
this lib dir it will install all the perl modules required to build emc and its
dependancies.

Second: the emc build scripts will runa nd use CPANPLUS::Dist::Deb to build
dependancy packages.

Third: debian-package-builder (created specifically for this purpose, not on
cpan) will be used to build the main elementalclinic debian package.

Fourth: all the debs will be copied to a temporary directory, any package that
already exists in ARCH-Name/ will be removed from the temp dir. Any remaining
debs int he temp dir will be copied to ARCH-Name/

Packages are ready!
